//String templates
//Triple-quoted strings are not only useful for multiline strings but also for creating regex patterns as you don't need to escape a backslash with a backslash.
//
//The following pattern matches a date in the format 13.06.1992 (two digits, a dot, two digits, a dot, four digits):
//
//fun getPattern() = """\d{2}\.\d{2}\.\d{4}"""
//Using the month variable, rewrite this pattern in such a way that it matches the date in the format 13 JUN 1992 (two digits, one whitespace, a month abbreviation, one whitespace, four digits).

val month = "(JAN|FEB|MAR|APR|MAY|JUN|JUL|AUG|SEP|OCT|NOV|DEC)"
